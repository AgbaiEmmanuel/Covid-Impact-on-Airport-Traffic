# Covid-Impact-on-Airport-Traffic
Analysis on Covid-19 Impact on Airport Traffic in the year 2020 across 28 airports across few countries.

This dataset shows traffic to and fro the airport as a percentage of the traffic volume during the baseline period. The baseline period used for computing this metrics is from 1st Feb to 15th March 2020.

As some inspiration using #tableau I created this dynamic geospatial visualization with the following insights recorded:

*Total traffic volume,
*Duration in days,
*Total airports and cities,
*Top 5 airports with less COVID impact,
*Monthly trends of COVID impact,
*COVID impact by country. Etc

It was recorded that there were a total traffic volume of 7,247 during the period of 262 days at 28 airports in 27 cities.

United State of America was most affected by the covid with about 4,441 affected traffic volume, the covid impact was high through the months April till November.

On the baseline, there were no much deviation as the flights still had 3,159 perfect route.

Explore the dataset to see some more insightful visual. Thanks
